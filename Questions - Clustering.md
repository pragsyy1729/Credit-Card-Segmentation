Questions:
1. Number of clusters according to each of the methods
2. Calculation of indicators to check for clustering
3. Inferences for each of these methods - What do each of the clusters mean in each of the methods?
4. After how many iterations, convergence was achieved while using K Means? 
5. Find Within Cluster Variance, Between Cluster Variance, Overall Variance for all the clustering methods without using Scikit

Objectives:
1. Data Exploration:
	1. Data Cleaning
	2. Exploratory Data Analysis
	3. Data Visualisation
2. Clustering model: Find optimal cluster number using silhoutte score, and scores relevant to these models 
	1. K Means 
	2. GMM 
	3. DBSCAN
	4. Hierarchical Clustering
3. Post Model Analysis: Interpret the cluster meaning each of the clustering models find.
4. Compute Within Cluster, Between Cluster and Overall Variance
